# Homework 11

## Questions

- Which of the file creation's modifications were written to the disk before the crash, and which were not?

Answer: The log, directory inode and entries changes were written into the disk while the file's inode was not. As a result, the type of inode is still zero.

- Why was the file empty, even though you created it with echo hi > a?

Answer: Since the panic happens after creating file before writing data, `echo hi > a` doesn't write anything into it.

## Streamlining Commit

Since the modified blocks are still in cache, instead of copying them from log, we could flush them to disk directly.
